## Objective:
To reduce the amount of lines to read the news. To do this, we only extract the essential and relevant sentences to the news.

## Methodology:
Using extractive summarisation, we are able to rank the sentences in the article by cross referencing their relevance with each other. We then use this data to extract the essential and relevant sentences before churning them out as summaries for the news article. To understand extractive summarisation, I'd recommend taking a look at my [Extractive Summariser repo](https://github.com/jaotheboss/Extractive-Summariser)
